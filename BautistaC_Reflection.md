# Reflection - Professional Portforlio
**Carlos Bautista** <br>
I did this project by using HTML and CSS i used to desgin my own webpages that described things that i am passionate about and a resume with i put things like my certifications, skills, work experience, contact info and education level.</br>
<br>What I could have done differently was asked more help from the teacher</br>
<br>What i could have changed about this project is telling the teacher to actually explain the work</br>
