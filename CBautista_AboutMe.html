        My name is Carlos Bautista. I am 14 years old and a freshman at Inwood Early College for Health and Information Technologies.

        College has always been a first choice for me but I always struggled on picking a major that I wanted to pursue but this year I have decided that Im interested in creative wriiting and I wanted to he a writer.

        I have three main hobbies that I would say encompasses me as a person which is Soccer, Music, and Writing. Soccer I got into when I was 11 years old and ever since I have enjoyed everything about it, Music is a more recent passion I have developed from listening and expanding my music taste over the past couple months and learning how to play the guitar and produce music, and Writing I have always like it since I grew up loving comic books and creating interesting ideas in my head.
